# High Performance TensorFlow On Azure

This repository contains hands-on labs that demonstrate best practices and patterns for running high performance TensorFlow workloads on Microsoft Azure.

The labs cover many topics, including:
- Running TensorFlow on Azure remote compute targets: Azure GPU VMs, Azure Batch AI clusters, FPGAs
- Parallel training on multi-GPU Azure VMs
- Distributed training on GPU clusters
- High performance inference on GPU clusters and FPGAs
- TensorFlow on Azure Databricks
- TensorFlow model operationalization in Azure Container Services, Azure Kubernetes Services, IoT Edge
- Tensorboard and Azure Machine Learning integration

## Lab environment set up

The preferred environment for running the labs is Azure Data Science Virtual Machine on Linux. You can also run the labs from the local development environment. At this point we don't recommend running the labs in Azure Notebooks.
