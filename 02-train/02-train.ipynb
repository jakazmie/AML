    "The script trains a simple network with one hidden layer. The input to the network is a vector of 2048 floating point numbers - the bottleneck features created in the previous step of the lab. The output layer consists of 6 units - representing six land type classes. To control overfitting the network uses a Dropout layer between the hidden layer and the output layer and L1 and L2 regularization in the output layer.\n",
